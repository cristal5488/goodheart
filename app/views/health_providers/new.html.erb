    <h1>Facts about the blood supply</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of whole blood and red blood cell units collected in the U.S. in a year: 13.6 million</li>
      <br>
      <li>The number of blood donors in the U.S. in a year: 6.8 million</li>
      <br>
      <li>Although an estimated 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood at any given time, less than 10 percent of that eligible population actually do each year.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Blood cannot be manufactured â€“ it can only come from generous donors.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Type O negative blood (red cells) can be transfused to patients of all blood types. It is always in great demand and often in short supply.</li>
